A set of social buttons and a locker in one bottle. Give people a reason why they need to click your social buttons!

== Description ==

Social Locker is a set of social buttons and a locker in one bottle. 
It allows you to lock a part of content on a web page until a user clicks one of the social buttons (Facebook Like, 
Tweet Button, Google +1) and help you to get more likes/tweets/+1s, traffic and customers!

<strong>Do you still place social buttons on every page of your site? But users don’t click the ones as often as you would like?</strong>

You should **give people a reason** why they need to click your social buttons. Even if people like your content, 
site or fanpage, they don’t click the buttons because they don’t worry about you, your benefits or your traffic. 
It’s not their problem.

= Key Features =

* Any URL to like/tweet/+1. You can set any URL that will be used to share for social buttons.  
* SEO friendly. Locked content is still available for search bots (Google, Bing, etc).  
* Highly customizable. The plugin provides a considered html markup that allows you to create your 
own style for the locker. You can change colors, fonts, sizes, paddings, backgrounds, shadows, 
icons and all for any locker element. No coding required. Just add some CSS rules.
* Preset Styles and Effects. We want to make a use of our plugins as simple as possible.  
So we added some modern preset styles and effects for you. Every update we will add new ones. Feel 
free to use they.
* Remembers users who already unlocked your content (via local storage and cookies).  
* Compatible with all the popular browsers.  
* Locks any type of content: text, videos, images, links, forms and more.
