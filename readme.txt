Helps increase social media presence by asking visitors "to pay" for your content with a tweet, plus one, or a like.

== Description ==

Social Locker is a set of social buttons and a locker in one bottle. 
It allows you to lock a part of content on a web page until a user clicks one of the social buttons (Facebook Like, 
Tweet Button, Google +1) and help you to get more likes/tweets/+1s, traffic and customers!

<strong>Do you still place social buttons on every page of your site? But users don’t click the ones as often as you would like?</strong>

You should **give people a reason** why they need to click your social buttons. Even if people like your content, 
site or fanpage, they don’t click the buttons because they don’t worry about you, your benefits or your traffic. 
It’s not their problem.

= Key Features =

* Any URL to like/tweet/+1. You can set any URL that will be used to share for social buttons.  
* SEO friendly. Locked content is still available for search bots (Google, Bing, etc).  
* Analytic tools. The plugin comes with built-in analytics tools to track how users interact with the 
locker and which channels bring the most traffic.
* Highly customizable. The plugin provides a considered html markup that allows you to create your 
own style for the locker.
* Remembers users who already unlocked your content (via local storage and cookies).  
* Compatible with all the popular browsers.  
* Locks any type of content: text, videos, images, links, forms and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What differences between the free, premium and trial versions? = 
  
<strong>The free version allows:</strong>  
- To lock any part of the post content behind the Social Locker that will ask people "to pay" for your content with a tweet, plus one, or a like.  
- To set messages for the locker that people will see instead of the content  
- To view social impact by using the built-in statistics tools  
  
<strong>The premium version allows:</strong>  
- To do the same things as the free version  
- To set a separate URL for each social button.  
For example, you can set an URL to like for your Facebook Page (in order to send likes to your Facebook page and make users subscribers), set an URL to tweet for current page and set an URL to plus one for main page in order to increase your site SEO scores.
- To choose one of 3 locker styles (Secrets, Dandyish and Glass) that will be more suitable for your site style.  
- To set visibility options for your lockers. For example, you can hide lockers and reveal locked content automatically for registered users.  
- To use  advanced features like the Countdown Timer, the Close Icon, the Ajax option and more.
